# Book Recommendation System with Web Crawling Data
In this project we tried to build a Book Recommendation System which uses books, ratings and users data. We calculated correlations between users with Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Book data crawled from (1000 kitap)[www.1000kitap.com]. Users and ratings data generated randomly with respect to rating data(rating data-3, rating data+3) in book file.
